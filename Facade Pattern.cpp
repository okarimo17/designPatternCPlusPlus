/*
  in this example Client(main function) can use shapes draw function by ShapesFacade ,
  it doesn't need to work with the actual shape classes (Circle square Rectangle ...).
*/

/*
Problem
- this pattern is to be used to facilitate access to a large
number of modules providing one layer
interface
â€¢ Consequences
+ facilitates the use of sub-systems
+ promotes weak coupling between classes and
the application
- BUT functionalities of interfaced classes
may be lost depending on how is
realized the ShapesFacade
